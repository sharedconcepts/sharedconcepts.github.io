= Shared Concepts

== Workshop: "`Achieving a shared understanding of concepts`"

Join us on the 13th and the 15th of April for an exchange of views on how to achieve a shared understanding of concepts - terminology and definitions - across domains.

=== Purpose of the Workshop

Have you seen a term defined differently in one place from another?
Do you use or manage standardized terminologies/glossaries/thesauri?
How are these definitions mapped? Perhaps existing
terminologies/glossaries/thesauri can be made more useful in your
day-to-day work.

Many domains, such as geospatial, electro-technical, business and
telecommunications, and others maintain approved terms and
definitions through well-defined procedures, especially at
standardization bodies and consortia. We believe building
mutually-agreed links between concepts across domains would be
useful. How should we tie the concepts together, how can they be
maintained and  governed over time, and who is allowed to do so?

The workshop will focus on discussing a framework and procedures for
tackling these issues and work out any technical details at a later
time.

The https://eng.sdfe.dk/[Danish Agency for Data Supply and
Efficiency] is tasked with ensuring the presence of a sound
foundation of data underpinning decisions and major transitions in
society. In the past, this entailed updating the topographical maps,
which served as the basis for public administration in Denmark. Their
role today, is to ensure that data can effectively meet the new
challenges and unleash the potential of a digital society. This
requires interoperable public sector data, which can be combined and
used with the geographic data foundation. Consequently, the task of
the Danish Agency for Data Supply and Efficiency - as a data
producer, data distributor, data partner and basic data authority -
is to provide the data foundation for a digital Denmark.
